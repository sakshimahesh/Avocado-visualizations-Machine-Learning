Why I chose this Research project ?
As and when I researched, Mexico is the largest country which exports avocados to the USA every year.
And I wanted to see how there imports affect the US economy. 
Hence a research on this dataset, imports and other vital information of these goods.
Additionally, Mexico largest producer over 50% of the world's supply.300,000lb/year. 
Bio Fase's contribution to the rapidly growing Bioplastic Global market, $17.1 billion by 2025 (#SmartInvestments).

Machine LEarning algorithms and time series forecasting
Dataset - has 2 main products, organic and conventional avocados and 6 other sub products (bagged)

I have used 7 Machine learning algorithms, trained and splitting data to evaluate a better fit and best model accuracy.
I have used time series analysis for short term predictions

7 ML algo:
Linear Regression, Ridge Model, Lasso Model, KNN Model, SVR Model, Decision tree and random forest regressor
RMSE Linear Regr :  0.1439
RMSE Ridge Model :  0.1437
RMSE Lasso Model :  0.1437
RMSE KNN Model   :  0.1418
RMSE SVR Model   :  0.1354
RMSE Decis Tree  :  0.1547
RMSE Rnd Forest  :  0.149
RMSE TS Analysis :  0.1322

Long term predictions: SVR model sets the best accuracy which is around 81.06% based on RMSE score values
Small HAss avocados tends to sell more around 30-40% on an averge
Highest staistical assoication with small hass bags and total volume which is 96%
Random forest regressor could also be an option for best model
(split data to 30)
